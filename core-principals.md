# Reliablity First
Our core principal directing our work is relability. If we can find solutions that improve reliablity, we want to do them, even at the sacrifice of time to implement.

## What does high-quality code look like?
To measure code quality, we developed a rubric of five metrics used internally, but that also align with academic and industry standards.

### Readable
**Does the code follow the language’s idioms and naming patterns?** 
Code that is difficult to read makes it more challenging to maintain, improve, and document.

### Reusable
**Is the code written so that it can be reused?**
Code reuse is a cornerstone of developer collaboration. It saves time and energy, breaks down silos, and creates consistency as a whole.

### Concise
**Does the code adhere to DRY (don’t repeat yourself)?**  
The less repetitive the code is, the easier it’ll be to read, understand, and build upon. Complex code can lead to bugs and issues that will be tough to remediate.

### Maintainable
**Is the code written in a way that makes the functionality clear, transparent, and relevant to the problem at hand?** 
Well-maintained code means that developers minimize dependencies. Maintainable code also impacts developers’ ability to search and practice code-reuse.

### Resilient
**Does the code anticipate and handle errors?** 
Resilient code will maintain its functionality (or at least have minimal disruption) if there are errors. This goes a long way toward ensuring that code will, simply put, work.


## What does reliable tooling look like?
Studies have shown that productivity can increase by 30% by using an IDE. Here are some of the reasons:

### Key Features of IDEs
1. Streamlined Coding Process
Developing code efficiently is at the core of any Integrated Development Environment. A well-designed IDE simplifies the coding process through various features. Here’s how an IDE streamlines the coding process:

A. Code Editor Features
1. Syntax Highlighting:

Syntax highlighting enhances code readability by applying different colors to different elements (keywords, variables, comments). This visual aid helps developers quickly identify and correct syntax errors.

2. Code Completion:

Code completion suggests possible code snippets, variable names, or method names as you type. This feature accelerates coding by reducing the need to type out long, complex expressions and minimizing errors.

3. Intelligent Code Navigation:

IDEs offer tools for intelligent code navigation, allowing developers to quickly jump between files, classes, and methods. This feature is especially useful in large codebases, enhancing overall productivity.

B. Debugging Tools
1. Github copilot and copilot chat help us figure out what is wrong in our files.

2. **Variable Inspection and Tracking:**

IDEs provide tools for inspecting variables and tracking their values as the code runs. This helps identify and fix bugs by allowing developers to understand how variables change throughout the execution of the program.

C. Version Control Integration
1. Git, SVN, or Other Version Control System Integration:

IDEs often come with built-in support for popular version control systems such as Git and SVN. This integration allows developers to manage source code versions efficiently, track changes, and collaborate seamlessly with team members.

2. Branch Management and Collaboration:

IDEs provide features for creating, merging, and managing branches in version control systems. This simplifies collaboration by enabling multiple developers to work on different aspects of a project concurrently. Branching also facilitates the isolation of features or bug fixes.
