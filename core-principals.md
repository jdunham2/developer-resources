# Reliablity First
Our core principal directing our work is relability. If we can find solutions that improve reliablity, we want to do them, even at the sacrifice of time to implement.

## What does high-quality code look like?
To measure code quality, we developed a rubric of five metrics used internally, but that also align with academic and industry standards.

### Readable
**Does the code follow the language’s idioms and naming patterns?** 
Code that is difficult to read makes it more challenging to maintain, improve, and document.

### Reusable
**Is the code written so that it can be reused?**
Code reuse is a cornerstone of developer collaboration. It saves time and energy, breaks down silos, and creates consistency as a whole.

### Concise
**Does the code adhere to DRY (don’t repeat yourself)?**  
The less repetitive the code is, the easier it’ll be to read, understand, and build upon. Complex code can lead to bugs and issues that will be tough to remediate.

### Maintainable
**Is the code written in a way that makes the functionality clear, transparent, and relevant to the problem at hand?** 
Well-maintained code means that developers minimize dependencies. Maintainable code also impacts developers’ ability to search and practice code-reuse.

### Resilient
**Does the code anticipate and handle errors?** 
Resilient code will maintain its functionality (or at least have minimal disruption) if there are errors. This goes a long way toward ensuring that code will, simply put, work.
